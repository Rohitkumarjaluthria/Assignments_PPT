    "Feature extraction in CNNs: In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), feature extraction refers to the process of automatically learning and extracting relevant features from input data, typically images. CNNs achieve this through convolutional layers, where small filters are applied to the input image to detect patterns and features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
