    "Profiling and Performance Tuning: Profile the system to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical components to achieve the desired performance levels while minimizing resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost-Aware Architectural Design: Consider cost implications during the architectural design phase. Optimize data processing pipelines, model serving mechanisms, and storage solutions to minimize resource consumption and maximize cost efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Monitoring: Implement robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to promptly detect performance degradation or cost anomalies. This allows for proactive optimization and adjustments as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative Optimization: Continuously iterate on cost optimization strategies, making incremental improvements while monitoring the impact on performance. Regularly review cost-performance trade-offs to identify further optimization opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration and Communication: Foster collaboration between cost optimization and performance-focused teams to ensure alignment of goals and shared understanding of the trade-offs. Regularly communicate the cost-performance balance to \n",
    "stakeholders and maintain transparency throughout the project."
